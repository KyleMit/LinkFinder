LinkFinder
==========

Find all links to named anchors within the page so you can create descriptive links to content within a page.

Simply click the ID button in your browsers action buttons.  The page will display all available fragmented links.  You can click on any link for a preview of where the page will load.  Copy the address directly from the popover or from the address bar after clicking a link.  To hide the popups, just click the icon again and you can resume work.
